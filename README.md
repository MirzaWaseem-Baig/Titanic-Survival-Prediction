## Titanic Survival Prediction

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This repository contains the code and documentation for predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. This project serves as a fundamental exercise in data science and machine learning, demonstrating data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

### Project Overview

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. In this project, we use a dataset of Titanic passengers to build a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of survival for a given passenger based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to identify patterns and insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- **Model Building**: Training various machine learning models and selecting the best-performing one.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction**: Making predictions on test data and generating a submission file for the Kaggle competition.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle as part of the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition. It includes information about passengers such as:

- **PassengerId**: Unique ID for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git`
2. **Run the Jupyter notebooks** to explore the data and build the model.
